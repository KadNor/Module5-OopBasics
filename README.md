# Address Book
This project is part of the 5th module of the Java Training.

## The excise contains the following tasks:

- create an **AddressBook** class which contains several **Contacts**
- implement the *add*, *remove* and *search* methods
    - the methods are based on the contact name
- a contact has one or more **ContactData** items
- AddressBooks can be persisted using a StorageImplementation

## Bonus points:
- contact duplicates by name are not permitted
- use file storage with java serialization
